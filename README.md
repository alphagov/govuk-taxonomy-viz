# govuk-taxonomy-viz

## Purpose

This repo is for visualising the GOV.UK taxonomy. The aim is to aid colleagues with exploring the hierarchy.

There are [many ways to display hierarchical data](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-hierarchy), including trees/dendrograms, treemaps, icicles, sunbursts and circlepacking.

## Tree

You can click the nodes on the [interactive tree diagram](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govuk-taxonomy-viz/20190712_taxonomy-hierarchy-tree.html) to expand them to the next level. Filled nodes can be expanded; white nodes do not have any children and can't be expanded further.
